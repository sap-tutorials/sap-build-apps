# Create a Product List Page with Ratings
<!-- description --> Now that you have your backend, you can finish the product list page by adding data resources and binding the properties of your list item composite component.

## You will learn
- How to enable BTP authentication
- How to set up navigation between pages
- How to use destinations (or hard-coded URLs) to access data services
- How to set up data resources for your custom backend entities
- How to call backend functions
- How to bind data to your composite component




## Intro
After creating a composite component and setting up your backend, you will now create the front end UI that will consume both business data and your custom data.




### Add name of page to navigation
SAP Build Apps lets you create a navigation menu so you can go directly to different pages in your app.

1. Go back to your Social Media app.
   
2. Open the **Navigation** tab.
   
3. Click on the List of Products page link.
   
    Change the **Tab name** to `List of Products`.
   
    ![Fix navigation](navigation.png)

4. Click **Save**.





### Enable SAP BTP authentication
You need to enable SAP BTP authentication since you want to use entities and functions from Visual Cloud Functions in your app.

>SAP BTP authentication may be enabled already, if after clicking the **Auth** tab, you see this screen. If so, you can skip this step.

>![SAP BTP authentication complete](BTPAuthDone.png)


1. Go to the **Auth** tab.

2. Click **Enable Authentication**.

    ![Auth](auth.png)

3. Select **SAP BTP Authentication**.

    On the confirmation popup, click **OK**. 







### Create data resource for Northwind
As the business data, we will use the Northwind OData service, but we could have easily used a destination to an S/4HANA system.

In this step, if you want to use a destination that you have already set up to Northwind, you can follow the instructions in the second tab.

<hr>


[OPTION BEGIN [Without destination]]

1. Open the **Data** tab.

2. Under **SAP Build Apps classic data entities**, click **Create Data Entity**, and select **OData integration**.

    ![Northwind](Northwind.png)

    Set the **Base API URL** to `https://services.odata.org/v4/northwind/northwind.svc/`

    Click **Verify URL**.

    On the left, enable the **Products** entity.

    Click **Save Data Resources**.

    ![Northwind configuration](Northwind2.png)
   
3. Click **Save** (upper right).

[OPTION END]




[OPTION BEGIN [With destination]]

These instructions are for when you have a destination to the Northwind OData service. It is to illustrate how to connect to a data source via a destination, like for S/4HANA.

For more information on creating destinations that can be consumed by SAP Build Apps, see [BTP Destinations Integration](https://help.sap.com/docs/BUILD_APPS/431746e4c663458aa68d9754b237bfc6/9e468c9c15914739a483c718700caae1.html).

1. Open the **Data** tab.

2. Click **Add Integration**. 

    ![Add integration](Northwind-dest-add-integration.png)

    Then click **BTP Destinations**.

    ![BTP destinations](Northwind-dest-via-dest.png)

3. Pick the `Northwind` destination on the left.

    ![Select Northwind](Northwind-dest-pick-dest.png)

4. Click **Install Installation**.

    Select the  `Products` entity, and then click **Enable Data Entity**.

    ![Install integration](Northwind-dest-install.png)

    Click **Save**, the **Exit**.


[OPTION END]










### Create data resources for backend
1. Still on the **Data** tab, click **Add Integration**.

    Click **Cloud Functions**.

    ![Visual Cloud Functions](vcf-integration.png)

2. Select **Social Media Backend**
   
    ![Social Media Backend](vcf-backend.png)

3. Click **Install Integration**.

4. Select the **Rating** entity, and click **Enable Data Entity**.

    Select the **Comment** entity, and click **Enable Data Entity**.

    ![Entities enabled](vcf-entities-enabled.png)

6. Click **Cloud functions**.
   
    ![Functions tab](vcf-functions.png)
   
    Select **AverageRating**, and then click **Enable Cloud Function**.

7. Click **Save**, then **Exit**.






### Create variables
1. Go back to the UI canvas, and select **Variables**.

    ![UI variables](ui-variables.png)

2. Under **App Variables**, click **Add App Variable**.

    ![App variables](app-var.png)

    - Select the new variable (i.e., `variable1`), and rename it to `Ratings`.
    - Set the type to **List**, and the list item type to **Object**.

    ![Ratings app variable](app-var-type.png)

    >On the one hand, a type of object with no fields has no schema, so it is more difficult to work with in the formula editor. But on the other hand, it is compatible with any object and saves us the time of defining all the fields.

3. Under **Data Variables**, click **Add Data Variable**.
    
    Select **Products**.

    ![Remove delay](data-var.png)

4. Click **Save** (upper right).







### Bind composite component
Now that we have all the data in variables, we want to bind them to the list component.

1. Go back to **View**.

2. Select the Large Image List Item, and in the **Properties** tab, set the following:

    ![Binding](binding.png)

    | Field | Binding |
    |-------|---------|
    | Repeat with| The data variable **Products1**|
    | Title label | Data item in repeat – **current.ProductName** |
    | Rating | Formula<div>&nbsp;</div>`DEFAULT(FIND_BY_KEY(appVars.Ratings, "productID", STRING(repeated.current.ProductID)).avg,0)` |
    | RatingCount | `DEFAULT(FIND_BY_KEY(appVars.Ratings, "productID", STRING(repeated.current.ProductID)).count,0)` |
    | Image source | For fun, I wanted each product to have a picture. The simplest was to take a service that returns a picture. Here's some formulas to return random pictures (no guarantee these will be working – feel free to use your own images):<div>&nbsp;</div>`"https://picsum.photos/100?random=" + repeated.current.ProductID`<div>&nbsp;</div>`"https://cataas.com/cat/says/" + repeated.current.ProductID`  |
    
    >The formula for the image may appear in red as an error, but it will work. Just save it.

    > The formulas for rating and rating count may have field names marked in red. Remember, we did not create a schema for our app variable, so the formula editor does know that these will exist.

2. Still with the Large Image List Item selected, and in the **Style** tab, set the following:

    - Edit the **default** style.

    - Under **Effects**, enable the shadow, set shadow size to **Medium**, and set the shadow color to static color `#AF9E8D`.

    - Click **Save**, then **Exit**.



### Get the rating data
1. Click an open area on the canvas, and open the logic pane.

    ![Page logic panel](logic-canvas-page.png)

2. For the Page mounted event, add an **Run cloud function** flow function, and then a **Set app variable** flow function, and connect them like this.
    
    ![Rating logic](ratings-logic.png)

3. Configure the "Run cloud function" to call the `AverageRating` function (this is probably already set since you only have one function).

    ![Configure function](ratings-logic1.png)

4. Configure the "Set app variable".

    | Field | Value |
    |------|--------|
    | Variable name | `Ratings` |
    | Assigned value | Formula<div>&nbsp;</div>`outputs["Run cloud function"].values.ratings` |

    >Again, the formula editor might show the formula in red because we did not set the schema for the app variable.

5. Click **Save** (upper right).






### Run the app
1. Click the **Launch** tab, and then **Open Preview Portal**.

    ![Launch](launch.png)

2. Click **Open web preview** (left).

3. Select your project, **Social Media**.

![Run app](runapp.png)

>The above is shown with the browser's developer tools, with the iPhone device set.

All of the products are shown, and all the ratings are 0 since we did not create a page to allow the user to add them. You'll do that in the next tutorial.
