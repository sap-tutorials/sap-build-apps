# 12 - Enable App to Select Product by Scanning Barcode 
<!-- description --> Show some of the native mobile capabilities of SAP Build Apps by allowing users to select a product by scanning a barcode, as part of the SAP Build CodeJam. 

 

## Prerequisites
- You have completed the previous tutorial for the SAP Build CodeJam, [Add Rework Flow to Your Process](codejam-11-spa-rework).





## You will learn
- How to get and set up the Mobile Preview App
- How to enable barcode scanning




## Intro
One of the best things about SAP Build Apps is that you can easily enable basic but powerful native mobile features – such as access to contacts and photos, the camera, location services and more.

In this tutorial, you will let you scan a barcode in order to select a product, instead of having to select from the list on the home page.








### Install preview app on your device
To get and set up the SAP Build Apps Mobile Preview App, watch and follow along with this video from **Daniel Wroblewski**.

### Add UI for barcode scanning
1. Go to the home page.
   
    Make sure you are toggled to **View**.

    ![Back home](backhome.png)

2. Right now, you have a title component.

    ![UI title](ui1.png)
    
    Add a Row component just above the title.
    
    >When you drag in a row component, it will automatically contain 2 cells.

    ![Add row](ui2.png)
    
    Move the existing title component into Cell #1.
    
    ![Move title](barcode-movetitle.png)
    
    In Cell #2, add a container, and in the container add a text and icon component.

    The UI should look like this:

    ![New UI](ui3.png)

3. Select the row component (use the tree view), and in the **Layout** tab click the first **50%**.

    ![Alt text](1-row-1.png)

    Set the cell width to `5`.

    ![Cell width](1-row-2.png)

    Now click the other side, now **0%**, and then enter for the cell width `3`.

    ![Cell width, again](1-row-3.png)

    This now sets the relative widths of the cells.

    ![Row widths](1-row-4.png)

    Finally, set **Align cell content** to align bottoms.

4. Select the container in Cell #2, and in the **Layout** tab, in the **Layout** section, set the layout to **Horizontal**.

    ![Container layout](1-container.png)

5. Select the text component (in Cell #2) and set the following.

    - Under **Properties**, set **Content** to `Click to scan product`.

        ![Text](1-text-1.png)

    - In the **Style** tab, click the **Primary Paragraph** dropdown, and click **Edit**.
        
        ![Edit style](1-text-2.png)

        Under **Typography**, set **Text size** to **Small text**.

    - In the **Layout** tab, in the **Layout** section, change **Text align** to **right**.

6. Select the icon component (the star in Cell #2), and set the following.

    - Under **Properties**, in the **Icon** property, click the word **star**.

        ![Select star](selectstar.png)
        
        Enter `barcode` in the search, and click the barcode symbol.

        ![Icon](1-icon-1.png)

    - Under **Style**, click the **Primary Icon** dropdown, and click **Edit**.

        ![Style edit](1-icon-2.png)

        Under **Typography**, change the binding type for **Font size** to **Static number**, and change the font size to `60`.

Your UI should now look like this:

![Final UI](1-final.png)





### Add logic to scan barcode
Now lets create the logic for handling the tap of the barcode icon.

1. Select the icon component, open the logic canvas (at the bottom).

    ![Open icon logic](2-openlogic.png)

2. Create the following logic, and connect the flow functions as shown. 

    ![Basic logic](2-basic-logic.png)

    >The logic opens the barcode scanner, and if the user actually selects a barcode, then you test that value.
    >
    >- If the value is a product number and in our list of products – held in our data variable – then you navigate to the product details page.
    >
    >- If the value is not a product, you just alert the user.
    >
    >**IMPORTANT:** You must connect the top output of he QR code flow function with the If condition flow function.

3. For the **If condition** flow function, set the **Condition** to the following formula:

    ```JavaScript
    IS_IN_ARRAY_BY_KEY(data.Products1, "Id",outputs["Scan QR/barcode"].codeContent)
    ```

4. For the **Open page** flow function, set the **Page** to **Product Details**.

    ![Open product details](2-openpage.png)

    Set the **productID** to the **Output value of another node > Scan QR/barcode > QR barcode content**.

5. For the **Alert** flow function, set **Dialog title** to the following formula:

    ```JavaScript
    "No such product " + outputs["Scan QR/barcode"].codeContent
    ```

The logic should now look like this:

![Final logic](2-final.png)






### Test with preview app
Now you will use the mobile preview app so you can use the native functionality of the device.

>Make sure you have installed the preview app on your device.

1. Click the **Launch** tab, and then **Open preview portal**.

    ![Open launch tab](3-preview-1.png)

    You should now get a place to enter a code from your preview app.

    ![Preview portal](3-preview-1a.png)

2. Open the preview app on your device.

3. Follow one of the following:

    - **For US10:** If you are on a trial account, likely you are on an SAP BTP account in the US10 region.

        - Click **Other login options**.

        - Select **SAP Build Apps US10**, and then click **Generate Code**.

            A code will be shown.
            
            ![Preview on US10](3-preview-2.png)

    - **For EU10:** Just click **SAP Build Apps** and a code will be shown.

        ![Preview on EU10](3-preview-2a.png)

4. Take the code and enter it in the preview portal in SAP Build Apps.

    Press **Enter**.

    >The pin code can be entered upper or lower case, and you can press **Enter** instead of clicking **Confirm pin**.

    ![Enter code](3-preview-3.png)

    If all goes as planned, you will see that you have been authenticated.

    ![Authenticated](3-preview-3a.png)

    Your preview app will now update and show all the applications in your tenant. You should see something like this:

    ![Preview app authenticated](3-preview-4.PNG)

5. Click the **Shopping App** tile to open the app.

    Click the barcode icon.

    ![Barcode icon](3-preview-5.PNG)

    You can scan this barcode for product **HT-1020**.

    ![HT-1020](barcode.png)

    This should take you to the product details page, where you should see the details for **HT-1020**.
